# SQL Project: Sakila DVD Rental Database
# Overview
In this project, I delved into the Sakila DVD Rental database, which contains comprehensive information about a company specializing in renting movie DVDs.

# Task
The primary objective was to perform an in-depth investigation of a relational database. The project requirements were as follows:

All final queries must include a JOIN operation and an AGGREGATION function.
At least two final queries should incorporate either a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE).
Utilize a Window Function in at least one final query.
Present findings and insights through a concise and visually appealing presentation.

Slide 1: Question 1
